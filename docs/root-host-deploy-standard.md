# Root Host Deploy Script Standard

This repository must preserve a repository-root deployment entrypoint named:

- `deploy-host.ps1`

The contract for that file is:

1. It must be a single-file operator entrypoint.
2. It must remain usable even when an operator downloads only this one file
   from GitHub.
3. It must not require the operator to manually clone or checkout the full
   repository before the first run.
4. If the local repository layout is missing, the script must bootstrap a
   local repo cache automatically before invoking any canonical internal
   deploy scripts.
5. If the full repository is already present, the script should fast-path to
   the local checkout instead of downloading another copy.
6. README deployment examples must point operators at `deploy-host.ps1`
   first, not at a deeper helper script.
7. The single-file entrypoint may delegate to repository-local scripts only
   after it has ensured the required repo files are present locally.
8. When the product supports blank-host deployment from GHCR or import-code
   style bootstrap, the root script should prefer that path over local-image
   shortcuts.
9. The script should expose at least one no-side-effect self-check mode such
   as `-ResolveRepoOnly`, so future maintainers can verify the bootstrap path
   without launching the full runtime.
10. The default Docker deployment path must not bind-mount repository source
    files such as `../server` into `/app/server`, because that breaks GHCR
    image verification and lets stale repo-cache content override the image.
11. The root deploy path must expose these artifact upload percentages as
    explicit operator-facing configuration, not only as implicit code defaults:
    - `REGISTER_OPENAI_UPLOAD_PERCENT`
    - `REGISTER_CODEX_FREE_UPLOAD_PERCENT`
    - `REGISTER_CODEX_TEAM_UPLOAD_PERCENT`
    - `REGISTER_CODEX_PLUS_UPLOAD_PERCENT`

Future deploy changes must preserve this contract.

## Import Code Distribution

When this repository publishes runtime configuration through Cloudflare R2,
the canonical operator path must preserve all of these rules:

- the release workflow publishes an encrypted import-code artifact for the
  trusted operator path
- `deploy-host.ps1` accepts either `-ImportCode` or `-BootstrapFile`
- the root entrypoint consumes that import-code/bootstrap path directly
  instead of forcing operators back to manual config editing
- the encrypted artifact protects a bundle that contains R2 location data,
  manifest/object keys, read credentials, and sync metadata
- the owner private key input may be either:
  - a raw base64url Curve25519 private key
  - or a stable passphrase string that deterministically derives the same key

The corresponding public key can be derived locally with:

- `python scripts/easyregister-import-code.py derive-public-key --private-key-file <owner-private-key.txt>`

## Canonical Docker Naming

This repo must keep the short slug `easy-register` as the operator-facing
default. Preserve:

- Docker Compose project name `easy-register`
- primary runtime container name `easy-register`
- default local image name `easy-register/easy-register:local`

The default deployment shape must remain:

- one Docker runtime container
- one mixed scheduler instance
- multiple flow specs supplied through `REGISTER_FLOW_SPECS_JSON`

The root deploy entrypoint must also materialize the current mixed-runtime
concurrency contract as explicit deployment config, not just as code defaults.
Current canonical values are:

- `REGISTER_WORKER_COUNT=10`
- `REGISTER_MAIN_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT=5`
- `REGISTER_CONTINUE_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT=2`
- `REGISTER_TEAM_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT=1`

Do not regress the default operator path back to three role-specific runtime
containers unless the user explicitly asks for that split.
